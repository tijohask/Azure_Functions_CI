# Azure_Functions_CI
Demonstrates the continuous integration functionality of Azure functions

You can edit the existing triggers, or add a new one with `func new` assuming you have Azure CLI and Azure Functions Core Tools installed

Whenever edits are pushed to the main branch, the pipeline pushes them to Azure automatically.
